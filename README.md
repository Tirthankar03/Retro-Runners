# Retro-Runners
Abstract :
Buying new or used books at an official store might be expensive for some students.
Additionally the difficulty of finding relevant course books is also difficult. Thus a
platform for sharing/selling used books, materials, instruments, etc can be of great
benefit to all students.
Benefit to students: Students will be able to buy and sell books and goods at good
prices for both parties excluding the middlemen normally encountered. This also
fosters a community feeling among students. Students can thus emsire easy
continuity of knowledge within the campus.

Problem statement:

Intra-college virtual store:
Buying new or used books at an official store might be expensive for some students.
Additionally the difficulty of finding relevant course books is also difficult. Thus a
platform for sharing/selling used books, materials, instruments, etc can be of great
benefit to all students.
Benefit to students: Students will be able to buy and sell books and goods at good
prices for both parties excluding the middlemen normally encountered. This also
fosters a community feeling among students. Students can thus emsire easy
continuity of knowledge within the campus.

Abstract :

•	The project aims to create an intra-college virtual store platform.
•	The platform aims to revolutionize the student experience by offering new features such as renting and bartering in addition to buying and selling.
o	Renting will allow students to borrow items they need for a short period of time without having to buy them outright. 
o	This is particularly useful for expensive course materials such as textbooks or equipment that students may only need for a limited time. 
o	Similarly, bartering enables students to exchange goods or services without involving money, which can be particularly helpful for students who are on a tight budget.
•	The platform aims to provide affordable access to books, materials, and goods to help students save money and easily find relevant course resources.
•	The platform also allows users to give ratings and reviews to buyers and sellers, which helps improve the overall experience by promoting transparency, accountability, and fair business practices. 
•	Another key feature of the platform is that it allows buyers to put up requests for items that are not already listed on the platform. 
o	This feature provides a platform for students to communicate their needs, and it enables sellers to meet the demand by offering new products or services. 
•	The platform aims to foster a sense of community, promote knowledge continuity, and eliminate middlemen.
•	The platform aims to empower students, encourage collaboration, and create an accessible hub for resource sharing within the campus.
